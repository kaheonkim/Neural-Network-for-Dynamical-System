# Neural-Network-for-Dynamical-System
It is for my undergraduate thesis, aiming to investigate ways of utilizing neural network for prediction, generation, and classification tasks for dynamical systems.

I want to maximize utility of neural network to be utilized to the realm of dynamics. This would bring a great potential in that many phenomena, including climate change, finance, and fluid can be modeled through dynamical system.

Especially, the last part is for my graduation dissertation for my Bachelor's degree. The topic is related to classification of dynamical system data, and I utilized Sparse Identification of Nonliner Dynamics(SINDy) as a medium for classfication tasks. After I fininshed a submission, I will write a detail for the project.
